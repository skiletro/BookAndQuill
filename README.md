# Todo
- [x] Page turning
- [x] Saving to file
- [x] Loading from file
- [ ] Refactor Javascript backend
- [ ] Test on Linux
- [ ] Test on macOS

Any suggestions for features would be much appreciated!

# Running
`yarn install`

`yarn run start`

# Compiling
Currently set up to compile to a single portable `.exe`. This takes a while to launch, but you can always use the unpacked version found in `dist/win-unpacked`

`yarn run build_portable`

# Notes
This is my first time creating an electron app + my first real project with node. The code is going to be awful and needs seriously refactoring.
