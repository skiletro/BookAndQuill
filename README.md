# Installing
If you don't want to bother compiling yourself, you can download an executable from the releases tab, or [here](https://github.com/skiletro/BookAndQuill/releases/latest).

# Compiling

`yarn install`

`yarn run dist`

This will output a portable `.exe` file, as well as an installable `.msi` file in the `/dist` folder. You can also run and use the unpackaged version in `/dist/win-unpacked`.

# Notes
As this is my first time using Electron, and to a lesser extent the node ecosystem, expect the code to be messy and not up to best standards. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open up an issue or PR.
